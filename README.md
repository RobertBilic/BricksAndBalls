# 🧱 Bricks and Balls — Architectural Showcase (Unity)

A simple "bricks and balls" style game created as part of a technical assignment, redesigned to highlight **clean architecture**, **modular systems**, and **custom physics** in Unity.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

While the gameplay is intentionally simple, this project was built to demonstrate:

- **Decoupled game systems**
- **Clean separation of concerns**
- **Custom 2D physics handling**

It serves as a **technical showcase** of how to build maintainable and testable Unity code — ideal for portfolio and interview contexts.

---

## 🧠 Architectural Highlights

- ✅ **Custom Physics System**  
  No reliance on Unity’s built-in physics. Includes basic collision detection and response.

- ✅ **Modular Game Loop**  
  Separated ball logic, brick handling, input, scoring, and state transitions via clear subsystems.

- ✅ **ScriptableObject Configs**  
  All tuning (ball speed, brick health, levels) done via `ScriptableObject` data — designer-friendly.

- ✅ **Minimal Dependencies**  
  No external packages. Fully self-contained, lightweight, and fast to load.

- ✅ **Leaderboard System**  
  Placeholder leaderboard UI with random entries.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Launch a ball to destroy bricks
- Bricks take 1+ hits based on durability
- Score increases with each successful hit
- Point multiplier after using up all the balls

---## 🧪 Requirements

- **Unity 2022 LTS or later**
- No additional packages required

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

This project is ideal for:

- Portfolio review (architecture-focused)
- Demonstrating clean Unity design principles
- Teaching or onboarding junior developers
